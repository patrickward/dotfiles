= Patrick Austin Ward Dot Files 

I've culled these config files together from a variety of sources â€“ many of which I can no longer identify. I've tried to give credit where credit is due. Some excellent sources of inspiration and, well, direct code snippets, include: 

The excellent Advanced Command Line Screencast at: https://peepcode.com/products/advanced-command-line

Ryan Bates wonderful dotfiles at: http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles

Use these as you will. Be brave, yet careful, lazy, yet prudent.
